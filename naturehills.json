    "description":"Wavy edges in soft blue-green, the Dancing With Dragons Hosta (Hosta 'Dancing with Dragons') the rippled and undulating leaves with long points. Enjoy the near-white undersides of each leaf when they flutter in the breeze. The blue cast to the leaves adds a cooling hue to the landscape, and the glaucous bloom over the foliage surface adds a touch of whimsy as water readily beads up or pools on the leaves!",
