        <![CDATA[What makes a good logo knife? It should be affordable, and it should have some large flat areas on the blade or frame suitable for logo imprinting. So we are very happy to present the Pazoda™ series. They're high-quality knives that are priced low enough to purchase in quantity, and all have flat areas that are perfect for our "Company Billboard" imprinting by laser or silk screen. Or you can take any one to your local trophy house for personalized engraving.]]>

Ed Halligan. It stands for "Keep It Super Simple."<br><br>The Original K.I.S.S.® blade shape is Tanto-inspired—Chisel-Point grind on the front and flat on the backside—so that when the blade is closed onto its handle/frame, the precision fit effectively "seals" the cutting edge to the frame, even though it's exposed. Both Razor-Sharp and Combined Razor-Sharp and Triple-Point™ Serrated edge grinds are available. Both blade and frame are 3CR13 stainless steel in a fine bead-blast finish.]]>

Ed Halligan. It stands for "Keep It Super Simple."<br><br>The Original K.I.S.S.® blade shape is Tanto-inspired—Chisel-Point grind on the front and flat on the backside—so that when the blade is closed onto its handle/frame, the precision fit effectively "seals" the cutting edge to the frame, even though it's exposed. Both Razor-Sharp and Combined Razor-Sharp and Triple-Point™ Serrated edge grinds are available. Both blade and frame are 3CR13 stainless steel in a fine bead-blast finish. <br><br>The design of the K.I.S.S.® series pocket/money clip permits them to be used in a variety of ways: clipped to the pocket; as a money clip knife; and with split-ring or lanyard, as a key chain knife.]]>

        <![CDATA[<b>Doesn’t abide by curfews.</b><br><br>Great design often comes from unexpected moments. So when knifemaker Russ Kommer’s eight-year-old granddaughter showed him one of her rough sketches, the two began plugging away in Russ’ workshop to refine it into the Curfew™. A sleek everyday carry, this folding knife deploys the blade smoothly and quickly thanks to Ken Onion’s award-winning Assisted Opening. While its original inspiration comes from someone young enough to have a curfew, this knife definitely isn’t bound by one.]]>

        <![CDATA[<b>Hiding in plain sight.</b><br>You might think the Scribe™ is a sleek USB drive, but you’d be mistaken. Instead of a sheath, this everyday carry fixed blade neatly snaps into a cap to conceal the black stonewash drop point blade. When in use, the cap securely attaches to the pummel of the knife—extending the handle for better purchase. The tough D2 blade steel and black stonewash pocket clip make the Scribe™ a discreet carry companion ready for anything. Only available at CRKT.com.]]>

Glenn's patent pending integral Lock Back mechanics are such that, the tighter you grip the handle—the stronger the blade lock-up. Brian's drop point blade design flows nicely from the handle shape, and its subtle recurve along the cutting edge is a nice touch as well. To keep the blade action smooth, a specially caged mini ball bearing system affords fast and smooth operation. A custom removable stainless steel clothing/gear clip is provided.]]>

All in all, it’s a strong and lightweight folding knife with a time-honored design.]]>

        <![CDATA[<b>Introducing: the Padawan.</b><br><br>Why name it the Padawan? As an apprentice to renowned knifemaker Flavio Ikoma—known to some as the “Master”—Buzetti's role as “padawan” was the perfect inspiration to debut his first design. Pedro Buzetti’s first knife design with CRKT, this capable folding knife was crafted for form and function, with a drop point blade made from 14C28N steel, and a handsome micarta overlay on the handle for improved grip. The frame lock was modified to keep the blade secure, and the clip lets the knife sit low in the pocket.]]>
